## Show The Local Weather

An app that leverages the user's current location to provide a simple weather forecast.

The app must fulfill these user stories:

1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The app is built as part of [freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Front-End Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather).
